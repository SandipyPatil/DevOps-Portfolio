Agile Principles:-
1. Agile is an iterative, collaborative approach to software development using small, cross-functional teams.
2. The Agile approach emphasizes flexibility, interactivity, and transparency.
3. The Agile Manifesto describes the core values of Agile:
	3.1 Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
	3.2 Working software over comprehensive documentation.
	3.3 Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
	3.4 Responding to change over following a plan.

Traditional Waterfall Development
Requirement -> Design -> Code -> Integration -> Test -> Deploy

Problems with waterfall approach
1. No provisions for changing requirements.
2. No idea if it works until the end.
3. Each step ends when the next begins.
4. Mistakes found in the later stages are more expensive to fix.
5. There is usually a long time between software releases.
6. Teams work separately, unaware of their impact on each other.
7. The people who know the least about the code are deploying it into production.
