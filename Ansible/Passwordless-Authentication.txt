How to setup Password-Less Authentication in Ansible?

The first question that comes into my mind is why do we need it? 
-> The reason of this passwordless authentication is because Ansible needs to perform some tasks on the target servers, Hence we needed this password-less authentication, so that master server can communicate with the workers server without any issues.

* Easiest way to do this using the "ssh-copy-id <PRIVATE ID ADDRESS>"
Sometimes this way doesn't work properly because sometimes, ssh-copy-id doesn't have enough permissions to do it.

* Another way to do the password-less authentication is below:
    When you try to SSH into your target servers, it will ask for password. We can resolve this by following the below steps.

    Step 1: Run the below command in Master Instance:
    ssh-keygen //This will generate a public and a private key in the same location /home/ubuntu/.ssh/*.

    Step 2: Now I have to login to our worker(target) servers and run the same command 
    ssh-keygen // This will also generate a public and a private key in the same location.

    Step 3: Open the Master server again and copy the content of id_rsa.pub(This is basically our public key). // We should always communicate with our Public keys.

    Step 4: Login into your target servers again and open the file "/home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys". Edit the file and paste the content of Master server's "id_rsa.pub" into it.

    Step 5: Now SSH into your worker nodes from your master node:
    ssh <PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS> // You will be able to ssh into your worker nodes now.

This is a pre-requisite to use the ansible. Suppose now a new CentOS server is introduced or any server with any distribution, you need to copy the content of "id_rsa.pub" and paste it in the "authorized_keys" of the target server.
